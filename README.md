The project utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm, a widely used algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
The goal of this project is to find the shortest travel path from a source to a destination, taking into account both bus and plane travel. The challenge is that the plane can only be used once in the entire journey.
By optimizing travel time, this project helps users plan efficient trips and save valuable time.
